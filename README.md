## 📊 Detailed Analysis

### 🔹 Income
- Main sources: `Salary`, `My Shop`
- Income exceeds the target significantly (+$85K)
- Income concentration on limited sources → financial risk if one source drops

### 🔹 Expenses
- Major categories: `Housing`, `Transportation`, `Personal`
- Subcategories such as `Internet`, `TV Subscription` can be optimized
- Expense = **~92% of income** → unsustainable in long term

### 🔹 Saving Rate
- Only **6.9%**, which is critically low
- Below personal finance best practice benchmark (>20%)

## 💡 Business Suggestions

### 1. 📉 Optimize Expenses
- Review and reduce non-essential expenses (e.g., subscriptions, utilities)
- Apply the **50/30/20 budgeting rule**:

  - 20%: Savings

### 2. 💰 Increase Saving Rate
- Automate transfers to savings account after income is received
- Set monthly savings goal (e.g., at least $20K/month or 20%)

### 3. 📈 Diversify Income Streams
- Explore additional income sources: freelance, content creation, passive income
- Add column to categorize income as:
  - 🔁 Recurring
  - 🆕 One-time

### 4. 🚨 Add Alerts and KPIs
- Create visual indicators if:
  - Saving Rate < 10%
  - Expense > 80% of income
- Suggested KPIs:
  - `Savings Health Status`
  - `Spending Deviation`
